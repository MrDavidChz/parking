## Utilities to download images from the Internet to train TensorFlow

### Google

I prefer this tool over ImageNet, since Google provides images matching a ceratin search key. The problem in this way is that you can only get around 100 images.

### ImageNet

You can get a number of images from [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/).
